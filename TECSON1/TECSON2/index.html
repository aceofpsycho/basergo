      To My Forever
    </h1>
    <p class="glassText">
       Hello love! I hope you liked the gift that i made for you. You were my inspiration to my life, to my academics, basically to my everything, and this is the least that i can do
       to repay you. You helped me find out who i truly am, what my bad habits and good ones were, and ultimately things that I haven't discovered before we met. You truly are a very significant figure to
       my life, second only to my parents. You were my light, my guide to my improvement, a mentor, a teacher, a lover, and my friend. You were there during my times of need, and you provided
       me with all of your love. I hope you can say the same to me, that I was there for you during your darkest times. But today is a happy day, because today marks your 16th lap around the sun.
       I hope for many for laps, as many as possible(and hopefully with me and nobody else). I really appreciate the love, dedication, patience, and forgiveness that you have given me these past few years.
       It has made me grow and be a better person for us, and for our future. We've had our fair share of problems and arguments, up to the point where we would argue almost everyday, but we would always be able to get 
       pase those hurdles, and come out a better person than we were. I'm sorry for all the times that I have deeply hurt you, and I apologize that sometimes I repeat these mistakes. I truly cherish all the time and memories
       that we have created together. You are one of the most(if not the most) wonderful happening of my life. You are my pillar, my guide, the single ray of light in this bleak world, the salvation that I cherish. You are the most
       precious human on this world, and I would be utterly devastated when i lose you. I am glad to have found someome who is as loyal, who is as loving, and who is as committed as you. I love every aspect of you, from your best to your worst features. I love every
       aspect of you, from the traits you take pride on, to the insecurities you hate the most. I hope that the day of your birth will be a joyous one, one filled with laughter and joy with your friends and families. I hope that one day i would be able to join them laughing, but alas, that
       is still pretty far fetched in the future. I hope that the future will be better to you and to us, with it being bright and full of positivity and joyfulness, and hopefully with us being officially together. I hope that the two of us will cotinue to improve and
       be better to each other and to the people around us. I hope that you will continue to love me (kay kung dili tuk on jud tika) and that we will continue to make memories together. I still remember the time that the first time we played roblox together. It was in the Mimic, and it was truly 
       one of the best moments in my life. Even now, we've been creating the best moments and memories together, strengthening our bond with each. Without you, I would have not reached where I am right now. You served as a crucible for me, a forge of strengthening, which further molded me into a better 
       person. You were the sole reason that i got good at academics. During grade 7, you know that i got the most horrid grades ever. But you sparked something in me, a will, a desire to improve, to improve for the sole reason to
       be desirable for you, and so i did. I acted on that desire, and with that desire, I improved because of you. For everything that you have done in my life, I want to thank you. Once again, have a happy day, my love!!!!!:))))))
